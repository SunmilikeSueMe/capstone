# Capstone Project
**By _Emmanuel Adams, _Muhammad Al Mahdi, _Imam Hasan Araf, Sunmisola Ogundairo

A repository for all documents and deliverables for the Computer Vision project, serviced by team 7 of Deloitte's AI Academy, cohort 4.

# Overview

Computing Vision (a made-up company for the purposes of this project) sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t have much background in creating movies. We are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office using different samples of available data. We then will translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Computing Vision's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
